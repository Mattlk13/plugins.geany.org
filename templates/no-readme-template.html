<h2>{plugin_name}</h2>
<p>The {plugin_name} plugin unfortunately does not have a README file yet,
where the contents for this page could be obtained from. If you are the
maintainer of the {plugin_name} plugin you are appreciated to write a
README file for your plugin as a small documentation about what your plugin
does, how to use it and so on. You can get some inspiration on how to write
that by having a look at the other plugin pages.<br /> If you like to
contribute, feel free to write a README file for the {plugin_name} plugin
and send it to someone who as write access to the Subversion repositories of
Geany Plugins. Most likely a <a href="https://www.geany.org/about/geany/">
Geany developer</a> is such a person.</p>
